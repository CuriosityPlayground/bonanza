// acquires locks and enqueues an operation. ActionRouter is responsible
// for the following things:
//
//   - To extract invocation keys from the client's context, so that
//     InMemoryBuildQueue can group operations belonging to the same
//     client and schedule them fairly with respect to other clients.
//   - To create an initial size class selector, which InMemoryBuildQueue
//     can use to select the appropriate worker size.
